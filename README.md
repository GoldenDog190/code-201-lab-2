    <h1>About Amelia</h1>
    <p>I live in Marysville, WA, and have lived in the Seattle area my whole life. I got my B.A. in Japanese language and culture at Western Washington University, and I have also studied international business there. I studied abroad in Tokyo at Musashi University for a semester. I have worked as a day care assistant at my church. I also have volunteered at animal shelters because I love animals. My current job is working at a veterinary hospital as a kennel technician. My goal is to get into a career working with technology, and be able to use my knowledge of the Japanese language and business to be able to work at a company like Nintendo or Pokemon or work at a business that has dealings with Japan.</p>
